        <section>
            <p>Copenhagen (Danish: København) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark, with a
                population of 1.4 million in the urban area.[7][8] The city is situated on the islands of Zealand and
                Amager, separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the Øresund strait. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities
                by rail and road.</p>
            <p>Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel
                Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. During the 16th century, the
                city served as the de facto capital of the Kalmar Union and the seat of the Union's monarchy, which
                governed most of the modern-day Nordic region as part of a Danish confederation with Sweden and Norway.
                The city flourished as the cultural and economic centre of Scandinavia during the Renaissance. By the
                17th century, it had become a regional centre of power, serving as the heart of the Danish government
                and military. During the 18th century, Copenhagen suffered from a devastating plague outbreak and urban
                conflagrations. Major redevelopment efforts included the construction of the prestigious district of
                Frederiksstaden and the establishment of cultural institutions such as the Royal Theatre and the Royal
                Academy of Fine Arts. The city also became the centre of the Danish slave trade during this period. In
                1807, the city was bombarded by a British fleet during the Napoleonic Wars, before the Danish Golden Age
                brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. After World War II, the Finger Plan fostered
                the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes emanating from the city
                centre.</p>
            <p>Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development,
                facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and
                governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the
                Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has developed rapidly in the service sector, especially
                through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the
                completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of
                Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With several bridges connecting the
                various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades, and waterfronts. Copenhagen's
                landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces,
                Rosenborg Castle, Frederik's Church, Børsen and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant
                tourist attractions.</p>
            <p>Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen
                Business School, and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is
                the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the football clubs F.C. Copenhagen and Brøndby
                IF. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most
                bicycle-friendly cities in the world. Movia is the public mass transit company serving all of eastern
                Denmark, except Bornholm. The Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen.
                Additionally, the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway), and the Coast Line network serve
                and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2.5 million passengers a month,
                Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.</p>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Copenhagen is part of the Øresund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and
                Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden.[61] It is located on the eastern shore of the
                island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial
                islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the Øresund to the east, the strait of water that
                separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The
                Swedish city of Malmö and the town of Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound
                directly across from Copenhagen.[62] By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest
                of Malmö, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of Næstved, 164 kilometres (102 mi)
                northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi)
                southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sjællands Odde.[63] </p>

                southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sjællands Odde.[63]

                The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still
                referred to as the Fortification Ring (Fæstningsringen) and kept as a partial green band
                around it.[64] Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of
                Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby,
                Vigerslev, Vanløse, Brønshøj, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist
                mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>Copenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (Köppen: Cfb).[71] Its weather is subject to
                low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the
                year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate.
                While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with
                average temperatures around the freezing point.</p>
            <p> June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a
                day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 °C. By contrast, the
                average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per
                day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of
                sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year.[73]
                Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour
                period during the winter months[74] while summer temperatures have been known to rise to
                heights of 33 °C (91 °F).[75]</p>
            <p>Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably
                between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58,
                providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and
                sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10
                hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter
                solstices.</p>

            <h2>Demographics</h2>
        
            <p>Copenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic
                countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen
                (Byen København) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent
                municipalities: Dragør, Frederiksberg, and Tårnby.[103] Their combined population stands at
                763,908 (as of December 2016).</p>
            <p>The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most
                populous Nordic municipalities with 644,431 inhabitants (as of 2022).[4] There was a
                demographic boom in the 1990s and first decades of the 21st century, largely due to
                immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2022, 73.7% of the
                municipality's population was of Danish descent,[102] defined as having at least one parent
                who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 26.3% were of a
                foreign background, defined as immigrants (20.3%) or descendants of recent immigrants
                (6%).[102] There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the
                most common countries of origin of Copenhagen residents. Largest foreign groups are
                Pakistanis (1.3%), Turks (1.2%), Iraqis (1.1%), Germans (1.0%) and Poles (1.0%).</p>

            <h2>Cityscape</h2>

            <p>The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for
                centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and
                representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance
                of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets</p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Apart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark
                and one of the major hubs in wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a
                transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international
                appeal, in the same league as cities such as Barcelona and Amsterdam.[193] This is a result
                of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new
                Danish architects, designers and chefs.[149][194] Copenhagen Fashion Week takes place every
                year in February and August</p>

            <h2>Tourism</h2>
            <p>Tourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's
                harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been
                one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe.[136] Hotel capacity in the
                city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in
                international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of
                nearly 70% for Chinese visitors.[136] The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region
                surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million</p>
            <p>In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover.
                However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29%
                in that one year.[137] 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015.[138] In 2019
                Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.[139] In October
                2021, Copenhagen was shortlisted for the European Commission's 2022 European Capital of
                Smart Tourism award along with Bordeaux, Dublin, Florence, Ljubljana, Palma de Mallorca and
                Valencia.</p>
