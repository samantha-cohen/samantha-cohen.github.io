                <h2> International travel trends since Covid </h2>
                <p>“The worst year in tourism history.” It’s no surprise that 2020 was awarded this title. According to
                    <a href="https://www.unwto.org/covid-19-and-tourism-2020"> UN Tourism</a>, before Covid-19,
                    international tourist arrivals in 2019 were 1.5 billion. Once Covid hit, the World Health
                    Organization deemed the outbreak, Covid-19, a global health emergency, then a pandemic. All
                    worldwide destinations imposed travel restrictions while 27% kept their borders closed for
                    international travel.
                </p>
                <p>Between 2019 and 2020, international tourist arrivals declined about 75%, from 1.5 billion in 2019 to
                    381 million in 2020. This brought tourism back to levels seen during the 1990s.</p>

                        Statista</a> reports that international tourist arrivals increased by only 13 percent in 2021,
                    and continued to recover as the years went on, reaching 88 percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
                </p>
                <p>In 2024, international tourism was reported to almost completely recover, at 99 percent, to
                    pre-pandemic levels including several travel destinations surpassing 2019, pre-pandemic levels,
                    according to <a

                <p>Around 1.4 billion international tourists, which is classified as overnight visitors, were recorded
                    internationally in 2024 which is an 11% increase compared to 2023, or 140 million more.</p>
